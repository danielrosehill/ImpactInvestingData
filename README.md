# Impact Investing Data

This repository was created in order to house and develop data analyses and visualisations related to emerging approaches in the world of impact investing, development finance, and results-based finance.

These include:

- Outcomes-based finance 
- Outcomes funds
- Impact bonds and variants (development impact bonds, career impact bonds, etc)
- Debt instruments incentivising sustainability performance - such as sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) and sustainability-linked loans (SLLs)

Datasets are attributed to their original compilers. 

Markdown files (ending .md) are used throughout the repository to offer notes.

Data is made available in CSV and JSON formats and where possible is optimised for ingress to PostgreSQL-based database hosts.
